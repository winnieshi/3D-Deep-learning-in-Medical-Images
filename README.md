# 1. A typical architecture of 3D CNN
4 basic components: (1) local receptive field, (2) sharing weights, (3) pooling and (4) fully connected layers.  The mathematical formulation of 3D CNN is very similar to 2D CNN with an extra dimension  added.  The  basic  architecture  of  3D  CNN  is  shown as follows.
